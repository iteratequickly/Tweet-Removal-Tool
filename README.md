A modern browser-based Chrome extension for reviewing and deleting tweets from your own authenticated account on X (formerly Twitter). The tool runs entirely inside your active browser session and provides a visual, manual interface for selective bulk deletion.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Twitter/X. It only uses available browser sessions and official API endpoints to facilitate manual tweet management.

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 **Session-Based Authentication:** Reuses your existing logged-in browser session. No login credentials are ever requested or stored.  
- 🔍 **Runtime API Discovery:** Dynamically detects GraphQL operation identifiers and tokens already loaded by the official X web client.  
- 🖼️ **Visual Review Interface:** Browse tweets in a responsive grid with timestamps, preview text, and direct "View" links.  
- 🗑️ **Selective Bulk Deletion:** Choose individual items or use "Select All" to clear batches with a single confirmation.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Statistics:** Live counters track found, selected, and successfully deleted tweets during the process.  
- 🛡️ **Safety-First Design:** Features mandatory confirmation dialogs, rate-limiting delays, and an isolated execution environment.

## 🛠️ Technical Background

- **Architecture:** Executes in an isolated IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to prevent interference with the host page.  
- **Identity Resolution:** Resolves account handles via the `twid` cookie and `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` Redux store.  
- **API Mirroring:** Issues requests for `UserTweets` and `DeleteTweet` that exactly match the structure of official web client operations.  
- **Privacy:** No external servers, no background persistent storage, and no analytics. All data exists only in memory until the sidebar is closed.
